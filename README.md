# This is a way of connecting an EdgeRouter with a pfSense on a Peer-to-Peer OpenVPN connection.

Generate a secret-key on your EdgeRouter Router:
```
generate vpn openvpn-key /config/auth/secret
```

Now show and save this key to use it on the pfSense server:
```
sudo cat /config/auth/secret
```

```
```

+ Enter EdgeOS configuration mode to add the firewall rules needed using the network-group countries_allowed generated by the script:
```
configure

set firewall name WAN_LOCAL rule 30 action accept
set firewall name WAN_LOCAL rule 30 description Tunnel EdgeRouter-pfSense
set firewall name WAN_LOCAL rule 30 destination port 1197
set firewall name WAN_LOCAL rule 30 protocol udp

set interfaces openvpn vtun0 shared-secret-key-file /config/auth/secret

set interfaces openvpn vtun0 mode site-to-site
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 local-port 1197
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 remote-port 1197

set interfaces openvpn vtun0 remote-host pfsense-server.remote
set interfaces openvpn vtun0 local-host edgerouter.local

# This tunnel will run when the Edgerouter boots. It will:
Start the connection to the remote pfSense and start routing the networks defined, in this case are 10.0.0.0/8 and 10.1.0.142/32

# Testing
You can do a ping to a remote device on the remote network or to the remote pfSense box in the tunnel interface
```
ping 10.1.0.1
ping 10.1.0.142
```
